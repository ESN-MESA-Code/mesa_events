# Decisions

Decisions taken while building Phase 1 autonomously (the user was not available). Each entry:
date, decision, why. `docs/SPEC.md` stays authoritative; these fill its gaps.

## 2026-10-28 – Milestone 1 (foundation)

- **Own local Supabase ports (544xx) and project id `mesa-events`.** MESAttendance's stack was
  running on the default 543xx ports; a second stack on other ports leaves it untouched.
- **Versions:** Next.js 16.4.3 / React 19.3.1 (latest 16.x, newer than MESAttendance's 16.1.6 for
  security fixes), Vitest 4 and TanStack Table 8 (the APIs MESAttendance and shadcn examples use;
  Vitest 5 / Table 9 are fresh majors), Supabase CLI 2.121.0 as in MESAttendance.
- **shadcn/ui components are written by hand** (`components/ui`) in shadcn's pattern (cva +
  tailwind-merge) instead of running the shadcn CLI, which downloads from an external registry.
- **Confidentiality gate kept for everyone.** MESAttendance's organiser confidentiality rules
  (accepted once, versioned) now gate the whole member area, because any member can become OC or
  helper and see attendance lists. `is_workspace_member()` = Workspace Google account + accepted.
- **Roles:** team roles live in `role_members` (`source` = `group` from the Google group sync, or
  `manual` added by an admin, surviving syncs). Group addresses are env variables `GROUP_*`. The
  Treasurer counts as Finance (`has_role('finance')`). Executives are a role (replacing
  MESAttendance's `executives` table). Admin (IT) gets settings, role mapping and the jobs view,
  not data access. Roles are re-checked at each login (like MESAttendance's executive check) and
  synced daily by a pg_cron-enqueued job.
- **"Team" visibility:** Events, Comms, Finance/Treasurer and executives read every event
  (`is_team()`); members read events once they are on the calendar (not drafts/dropped); OC and
  helpers always read their own events.
- **Rosters are visible to members only after the month's allocation is confirmed**
  (`roster_published()`); before that only teams and the person themself see an assignment.
- **OC may edit their own event's details** (location, time, price, capacity, ends) and decide
  whether an under-staffed event runs (`understaffed → confirmed/cancelled`); title, type, helper
  count, cycle and Chat fields are Events-only (`guard_event_update` trigger).
- **No deletes through the API** for cycles, events, series, settings, logs, jobs (as
  MESAttendance: proof must not be destroyable by a stolen session). Events may delete
  assignments while adjusting the roster.
- **Activity log is written only by triggers / definer functions**, never by clients; bank details
  are stripped from logged rows.
- **Jobs queue:** one row per idempotency key; "coalescing" jobs (membership syncs) run again when
  re-enqueued after finishing, and once more if re-enqueued while running (`rerun`). Exponential
  backoff 1, 2, 4 … minutes (max 1 h), dead after `max_attempts` (6); admins retry dead jobs.
  pg_cron runs `private.invoke_job_runner()` every 30 seconds, which POSTs to the app via pg_net
  only when jobs are due. URL and secret live in `private.config` (a schema the API cannot see),
  not in the migration; locally the seed sets them.
- **Google clients pick themselves:** real fetch-based clients when a service account is
  configured, otherwise database-backed fakes (`fake_*` tables, service role only) so the whole
  workflow can be run and inspected locally. `GOOGLE_MODE=fake|real` overrides. Unit tests use
  in-memory fakes.
- **Chat API acts as a Workspace user via domain-wide delegation (`GOOGLE_CHAT_SUBJECT`)**, because
  creating spaces and managing members needs user authentication. Not verifiable locally.
- **Local test sign-in is impossible in production builds:** `localLoginEnabled()` returns false
  whenever `NODE_ENV === "production"` (inlined by `next build`), in addition to MESAttendance's
  flag + local-URL checks. The route answers 404 then. The login page lets you pick any seeded
  role.
- **DB tests sign JWTs with the local stack's secret** for the seeded users' real ids instead of
  password sign-ins (PostgREST checks only the signature), which avoids Auth rate limits; E2E
  tests use real password sessions. Local Auth rate limits are raised in `supabase/config.toml`.
- **CSP with a per-request nonce** (`'strict-dynamic'`), set in `proxy.ts`; the root layout reads
  `headers()` so every page renders per request and gets the nonce. No `'unsafe-inline'` scripts.
- **Server actions** are defined once as `(ctx, input)` functions (`lib/actions/*`) that validate
  with zod and check roles from the database (`my_context()`), and are exported from
  `"use server"` files through `run()`. This makes the server-side authorization testable with
  any member's context; RLS checks again underneath.
- **Times:** all input and display in Europe/Berlin via `@date-fns/tz` (`lib/dates.ts`), whatever
  the browser/server zone (unit tests run with `TZ=America/New_York` to prove it).
